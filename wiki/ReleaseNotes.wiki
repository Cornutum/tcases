= 1.1.0 =

  * Restructured as Maven project containing multiple modules, all downloadable from the Maven Central repository.

  * Now available as a [http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/tcases-maven-plugin/ Maven plugin], so you can use Maven to generate test cases directly from the system input definitions for your Maven project.

= 1.0.1 =

  * If generating JUnit (using the -J option), use a more useful default output file name of the form *${projectName}Test.java*. If necessary, convert the *${projectName}* part of the file name into a valid Java identifier. Consequently, -J does not have to be accompanied by -f to get good results.

  * When reading a system input definition document, report a failure for any reference to an undefined property. Write a WARN log message for any property definition that is not actually used.
