Tcases Plugin

  The Tcases Plugin runs Tcases, a model-based test case generator. With Tcases, you define a model
  of the input space for your system-under-test and a model of the coverage that you want. Then
  Tcases generates a minimal set of test cases that meets your requirements.

  What is the "input space" of the system? The simplest way to look at it is this: the set of all
  (combinations of) input values that could possibly be applied. Easy to say, but hard to do! For
  all but the simplest systems, such a set is enormous, perhaps even infinite. You could never
  afford to build and run all those test cases.  Instead, you have to select test cases from a
  small sample of the input space. But how? If your sample is too big, you'll run out of time
  before you finish. But if your sample is too small \-\-\- or, worse, if it's the <wrong>
  subset \-\-\- you'll miss lots of defects.

  That is the test design problem: given a limited amount of testing effort, how can you minimize
  the risk of defects?  Tcases offers a solution. Tcases gives you a way to define the
  input space for your system in a form that is concise but comprehensive.  Then Tcases allows you
  to control the number of test cases in your sample subset by specifying the level of coverage you
  want. You can start with a basic level of coverage, and Tcases will generate a small set of test
  cases that touches every significant element of the input space. Then you can improve your tests
  by selectively adding coverage in specific high-risk areas.  For example, you can specify 
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pairs_testing}pairwise coverage}} or higher-order
  combinations of selected input variables.

  If you feel this plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can submit the issue
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}here}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive
  description of your concern. Especially for fixing defects it is crucial that the developers can
  reproduce your problem. For this reason, entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo
  projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.  Of course, patches are welcome,
  too. Contributors can check out the project {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}}.
