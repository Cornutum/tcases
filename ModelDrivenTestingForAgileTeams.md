# Model-Driven Testing Using Tcases #

Agile teams know that defects are a drag. Literally! The effort to fix defects bottlenecks the pipeline and busts the sprint. And when defects are reported in production, things really bog down. Looking for a better way?

Model-driven testing offers a systematic way to answer some important questions. Such as "Are my tests good enough?" And "How many tests do I need?"
